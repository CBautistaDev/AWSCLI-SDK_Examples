# Introduction to Amazon CloudFront

# Overview
This guide introduces you to Amazon CloudFront. In this lab you will create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that will use a CloudFront domain name in the url to distribute a publicly accessible image file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

# Topics covered
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Create a new Amazon CloudFront distribution
* Use your Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve an image file
* Delete your Amazon CloudFront distribution when it is no longer required

## Amazon CloudFront

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery web service. It integrates with other Amazon Web Services products to give developers and businesses an easy way to distribute content to end users with low latency, high data transfer speeds, and no minimum usage commitments.

Task 1: Store a Publicly Accessible Image File in an Amazon S3 Bucket
In this task, you will store the file that you wish to distribute using Amazon CloudFront in a publicly accessible location. You will store the image file in a publically accessible Amazon S3 bucket.

In the AWS Management Console, on the Services menu, click S3.

Click Create bucket and then configure:

Bucket name: 
cfBUCKET
Replace BUCKET with a random number
Scroll to the bottom of the screen, then click Create bucket
Note: If you receive an error saying that your bucket name is not available, try a different bucket name. For your bucket to work with CloudFront, the name must conform to DNS naming requirements. For more information, go to Bucket Restrictions and Limitations in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

Click on the S3 bucket you created.

Click the Permissions tab.

In the Block public access section, click Edit.

Deselect the Block all public access option, and then leave all other options deselected.

 Notice all of the individual options remain deselected. When deselecting all public access, you must then select the individual options that apply to your situation and security objectives. In a production environment, it is recommended to use the least permissive settings possible.

Click Save changes
A dialogue box opens asking you to confirm your changes.

Type 
confirm
 in the field, and then click Confirm

Click Objects tab.

Click Upload

Click Add files

Select an image that you would like to upload.

If you donâ€™t have a file prepared, visit a favorite website in your browser and download an image from the website to your desktop. Then choose that file for this step.

select the checkbox to acknowledge that existing objects with the same name will be overwritten
Scroll to the bottom of the screen, then click Upload

Click the file that you have uploaded.

Under Access control list (ACL), click Edit.

Under Everyone (public access)

Select  Read.
Select  I understand the effects of these changes on this object.
Click Save changes
Under Object Overview.

Under the Key copy the name of your file to your text editor for later use.

e.g. The name of your file could be myimage.png

Under Object URL, copy the link to your clipboard.

Paste the link in a new browser tab, then press Enter.

This will display your image. It also proves that your content is publicly accessible. However, this is not the URL you will use when you are ready to distribute your content.

Task 2: Create an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution
In this task, you will create an Amazon CloudFront web distribution that distributes the file stored in the publicly accessible Amazon S3 bucket.

In the AWS Management Console, on the Services menu, click CloudFront.

Click Create Distribution

On the Select a delivery method for your content page, in the Web section, click Get Started then configure:

Origin Domain Name: Select the S3 bucket you created
Scroll to the bottom of the page, then click Create Distribution
The Status column shows  In Progress for your distribution. After Amazon CloudFront has created your distribution, the value of the Status column for your distribution will change to Deployed. At this point, it will be ready to process requests. This should take around 15-20 minutes. The domain name that Amazon CloudFront assigns to your distribution appears in the list of distributions. It will look similar to dm2afjy05tegj.cloudfront.net

Amazon CloudFront now knows where your Amazon S3 origin server is, and you know the domain name associated with the distribution. You can create a link to your Amazon S3 bucket content with that domain name, and have Amazon CloudFront serve it.

Task 3: Create a Link to Your Object
Copy the following HTML into a new text file:

<html>
<head>My CloudFront Test</head>
<body>
<p>My text content goes here.</p>
<p><img src="http://DOMAIN/OBJECT" alt="my test image" /></p>
</body>
</html>
In your text file:
Replace DOMAIN with your Amazon CloudFront Domain Name for your distribution. You should see this on the CloudFront Distributions page.
Replace OBJECT with the name of the file that you uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket
Save the text file to your computer as 
myimage.html

Open the web page you just created in a browser to ensure that you can see your content.

The browser returns your page with the embedded image file, served from the edge location that Amazon CloudFront determined was appropriate to serve the object.

Task 4: Delete Your Amazon CloudFront Distribution
You can clean up your resources by deleting the Amazon CloudFront distribution and the Amazon S3 bucket.

In the AWS Management Console, select the check box  for your CloudFront distribution.

At the top of the screen, click Disable

Click Yes, Disable

Click Close

The value of the State column immediately changes to Disabled.

Wait until the value of the Status column changes to Deployed.

Select the check box  for your CloudFront distribution, then configure:

Click Delete then:

Click Yes, Delete
Click Close
Task 5: Delete Your Amazon S3 Bucket
On the Services menu, click S3.

Click S3 bucket you created.

Select  your file.

Click Delete

Confirm the deletion by typing 
permanently delete

Click Delete objects

On the Services menu, click S3.

Select your bucket again.

Click Delete then:

Enter the name of your bucket.
Click Delete bucket
You have now released the resources used by your CloudFront distribution and Amazon S3 bucket.
